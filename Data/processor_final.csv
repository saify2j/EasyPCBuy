AMD Ryzen Master
Your tool to unlock AMD Ryzen Processors
 Every AMD Ryzen processor is multiplier-unlocked from the factory
 so you can personalize performance to your taste. AMD provides the AMD Ryzen Master utility to access this powerful advantage
Personalized Performance
AMD Ryzen Master provides for up to four profiles to store custom clocks and voltage adjustments for both the Ryzen CPU and DDR4 memory. You can park cores and adjust memory timings
 too.
System Monitoring
Accurate hardware status updates are vital
 so AMD Ryzen Master has you covered with both real-time monitoring and a histogram of per-core clock rates and temperature
 including average and peak readings.
Virtualization Solutions
We understand doing more with less is an unavoidable challenge when conducting business today. To help you meet that challenge head on
 we developed a unique suite of innovative virtualization technologies and integrated them directly into all AMD Opteron processors.
With revolutionary architecture featuring up to 16 cores
 AMD Opteron processors are built to support more VMs per server for greater consolidation— which can translate into lower server acquisition costs
 operational expense
 power consumption and data center floor space.

 Simpler Storage Technology: Enmotus FuzeDrive for AMD Ryzen
In 2017
 AMD disrupted the processor market with Ryzen™ desktop processors
 delivering incredible multi-threaded performance to consumers. But in many ways
 platforms are just as important as the processors that sit on them. If you want to make a real difference in the way people experience PC performance
 you need to continuously push to open other bottlenecks like memory
 I/O
 and storage. That’s why we provided a free NVMe RAID upgrade to the X399 (Threadripper) platform in October of the same year
 enabling some of the most bandwidth ever seen on a consumer desktop platform.
While it’s great to push the limits of what’s possible for enthusiasts
 the average user isn’t going to invest a large amount of money in expensive
 high-capacity NVMe drives. So we looked for a way improve storage performance for everyone with a Ryzen desktop processor. We started with a list of goals
 like improving storage performance and lowering loading times. Because AMD believes in open hardware standards
 it prefers to work with off-the-shelf
 non-proprietary NVMe
 SSD
 and hard disk drives. Finally
 it must be convenient for users any superior storage acceleration solution needs to be easy to set up
 and simple to use.
 
Introducing Enmotus FuzeDrive for Ryzen
 Exclusively for AMD on Consumer Desktop PCs
To achieve these goals
 AMD partnered with Enmotus
 a company that develops high-end server-class storage solutions designed to optimize both performance and capacity in the data center. We worked together to tailor Enmotus’ FuzeDrive software for use with AMD Ryzen desktop processors in the consumer desktop PC space
 for systems using the AMD B350 and X370 chipsets (Socket AM4* Ryzen™ 7
 5
 and 3*) and the X399 chipset.
How does Enmotus FuzeDrive for AMD Ryzen work?
First
 the FuzeDrive software analyzes all of the storage hardware available on your system
 from fastest to slowest: from DDR4 RAM
 to 3D Xpoint NVMe drives
 standard NVMe drives
 SSD drives
 and mechanical hard disks. During the setup process
 it combines these disks into what your system sees as a single
 larger disk. Unlike caching schemes
 FuzeDrive lets you use both the SSD and the HDD capacity together as one large boot drive. For example
 you can now combine a 128GB SSD and 2TB hard drive into a large bootable 2.1TB high performance FuzeDrive.
Once installed
 FuzeDrive intelligently and continuously analyzes your system
 activating an ongoing process to make it as fast and responsive as possible. For instance
 your Windows operating system boot files are moved to the fastest non-volatile storage to accelerate boot times. And as you use your PC from day to day
 FuzeDrive notices what applications you run and automatically prioritizes the applications and data you use the most
 so it’s accessed as quickly as possible from the fastest storage tier available. That means faster boot times
 faster application and game load times
 and a more responsive system in your AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7 1900X."

Overview:
Overwhelming Power.
The AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X processor is designed to provide indisputable multi-processing
 
Supremacy on the X399 ultimate platform for desktop.
8 cores provide an astonishing 16 threads of simultaneous multi-processing power
 while 20MB of combined cache and vast I/O from the enthusiast-grade AMD X399 platform stand ready to feed the beast.

 Simpler Storage Technology: Enmotus FuzeDrive for AMD Ryzen
In 2017
 AMD disrupted the processor market with Ryzen™ desktop processors
 delivering incredible multi-threaded performance to consumers. But in many ways
 platforms are just as important as the processors that sit on them. If you want to make a real difference in the way people experience PC performance
 you need to continuously push to open other bottlenecks like memory
 I/O
 and storage. That’s why we provided a free NVMe RAID upgrade to the X399 (Threadripper) platform in October of the same year
 enabling some of the most bandwidth ever seen on a consumer desktop platform.
While it’s great to push the limits of what’s possible for enthusiasts
 the average user isn’t going to invest a large amount of money in expensive
 high-capacity NVMe drives. So we looked for a way improve storage performance for everyone with a Ryzen desktop processor. We started with a list of goals
 like improving storage performance and lowering loading times. Because AMD believes in open hardware standards
 it prefers to work with off-the-shelf
 non-proprietary NVMe
 SSD
 and hard disk drives. Finally
 it must be convenient for users any superior storage acceleration solution needs to be easy to set up
 and simple to use.
 
Introducing Enmotus FuzeDrive for Ryzen
 Exclusively for AMD on Consumer Desktop PCs
To achieve these goals
 AMD partnered with Enmotus
 a company that develops high-end server-class storage solutions designed to optimize both performance and capacity in the data center. We worked together to tailor Enmotus’ FuzeDrive software for use with AMD Ryzen desktop processors in the consumer desktop PC space
 for systems using the AMD B350 and X370 chipsets (Socket AM4* Ryzen™ 7
 5
 and 3*) and the X399 chipset.
How does Enmotus FuzeDrive for AMD Ryzen work?
First
 the FuzeDrive software analyzes all of the storage hardware available on your system
 from fastest to slowest: from DDR4 RAM
 to 3D Xpoint NVMe drives
 standard NVMe drives
 SSD drives
 and mechanical hard disks. During the setup process
 it combines these disks into what your system sees as a single
 larger disk. Unlike caching schemes
 FuzeDrive lets you use both the SSD and the HDD capacity together as one large boot drive. For example
 you can now combine a 128GB SSD and 2TB hard drive into a large bootable 2.1TB high performance FuzeDrive.
Once installed
 FuzeDrive intelligently and continuously analyzes your system
 activating an ongoing process to make it as fast and responsive as possible. For instance
 your Windows operating system boot files are moved to the fastest non-volatile storage to accelerate boot times. And as you use your PC from day to day
 FuzeDrive notices what applications you run and automatically prioritizes the applications and data you use the most
 so it’s accessed as quickly as possible from the fastest storage tier available. That means faster boot times
 faster application and game load times
 and a more responsive system in your AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7 1900X."
