High Density Glass Fabric PCB
What you’ve never understood about your computer is that it is scared to death of water
 H2O
 humidity or whatever you’d like to name it. And even though you do not see the water
 actually there may be lots of excessive moist in the air killing your motherboard silently and slowly. No
 your motherboard doesn’t melt when in contact with water like the wicked witch of the west
 but it dies of short circuit. Luckily
 ASRock has a new High Density Glass Fabric PCB design that reduces the gaps between the PCB layers to protect the motherboard against electrical shorts caused by humidity.
DDR4 Non-Z OC
Overclocking DDR4 memory modules is no longer limited to Z170 models. With ASRock’s DDR4 Non-Z OC users may overclock the memory of H170/Q170/B150/H110/C232 models using certain memory sticks
 such as Kingston or Samsung memory DIMMs. The enhanced CAS latency brings up to 5% performance boost.

Humidity can play havoc on a motherboard's circuitry.GIGABYTE's new Glass Fabric PCB design helps protect against electrical shorts due to humidity by reducing the gaps in spacing between PCB filaments.
Electrostatic Protection
GIGABYTE Ultra Durable 4 Classic motherboards feature High ESD Resistance ICs which help protect the motherboard against electrostatic discharge.
Power Failure Protection
Permanent damage from power surge or failure during BIOS update
 can be avoided with GIGABYTE DualBIOS
 which automatically enables a secondary
 back up BIOS. GIGABYTE also uses Anti-Surge ICs to protect the motherboard against power surges.
High Temperature Protection
GIGABYTE uses All Solid Caps (Capacitors) and Low RDS(on) MOSFETs which are rated to work at higher temperatures
 providing up to 50
000* hour component lifespan.
Navigating through the BIOS to change system settings can be a daunting task for users not familiar with control “F”functions and mouse-less navigation. While some EFI BIOS try to address this with a mouse friendly environment
 many implementations still lack a certain ease-of-use necessary for most people. With GIGABYTE Touch BIOS
 GIGABYTE engineers have completely re-imagined how users can interact with their BIOS
 allowing for a more intuitive user experience. In fact
 with a touch screen monitor
 GIGABYTE Touch BIOS is as easy to use as most apps on your iPhone.
GIGABYTE 6 series motherboards incorporate an Intel approved Intersil PWM controller that is VRD 12 (Voltage Regulator Down) compliant. This means that it offers new features that include SerialVID (SVID) which transfers power management information between the processor and voltage regulator controller
 allowing more robust and efficient signaling control between the CPU and PWM controller – hence
 delivering a more energy efficient platform.
