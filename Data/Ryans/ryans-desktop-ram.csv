VENGEANCE LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation
 and the eight-layer PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom.
DESIGNED FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE OVERCLOCKING
VENGEANCE LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation
 and the custom performance PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom. Each IC is individually screened for peak performance potential.
COMPATIBILITY TESTED
Part of our exhaustive testing process includes performance and compatibility testing on nearly every motherboard on the market – and a few that aren’t.
XMP 2.0 SUPPORT
One setting is all it takes to automatically adjust to the fastest safe speed for your VENGEANCE LPX kit. You’ll get amazing
 reliable performance without lockups or other strange behavior.
ALUMINUM HEAT SPREADER
Overclocking overhead is limited by operating temperature. The unique design of the VENGEANCE LPX heat spreader optimally pulls heat away from the ICs and into your system’s cooling path
 so you can push it harder.
LOW-PROFILE DESIGN
The small form factor makes it ideal for smaller cases or any system where internal space is at a premium.
MATCH YOUR SYSTEM
The best high-performance systems look as good as they run. VENGEANCE LPX is available in several colors to match your motherboard
 your other components
 your case -- or just your favorite color.
WORLD-FAMOUS RELIABILITY
There's a reason why world-champion overclockers
 extreme gaming enthusiasts and high-end system builders all trust CORSAIR for high-performance memory that they can install with confidence and pride. Whether you're breaking your own records or you're simply building a dream gaming rig
 you can count on CORSAIR memory.

Overview
CORSAIR 8-GB DDR4 standard was announced in 2007
 and while the specs have slowly improved over the last seven years
 the standard’s being pushed to its limit. DDR4 breaks through that limit
 with dramatically faster clock speeds and double the bandwidth and it uses less power
 too.  If you play high-resolution games or you run data-intensive applications like video editing
 you need the significantly better performance that DDR4 offers.
Features
Vengeance LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation
 and the eight-layer PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom. Each IC is individually screened for performance potential.
 
Pure aluminum heat spreader for faster heat dissipation and cooler operation
Overclocking overhead is limited by operating temperature. The unique design of the Vengeance LPX heat spreader optimally pulls heat away from the ICs and into your system’s cooling path
 so you can push it harder.The heat spreader doesn’t just allow Vengeance LPX to run better. ..the aggressive yet refined form factor looks great in showcase systems.
Low-profile design fits in smaller spaces
When the first Mini-ITX and Micro ATX motherboards for DDR4 are released
 Vengeance LPX will be ready. The small form factor makes it ideal for smaller cases or any system where internal space is at a premium.
Available in BLACK HEATSINK color to match your motherboard or your system
The best high-performance systems look as good as they run. Vengeance LPX is available in several colors to match your motherboard
 your other components
 your case or just your favorite color.
Designed for EnthusiastsBacked by Corsair World-famous reliability and performance
There's a reason why world-champion overclockers
 extreme gaming enthusiasts and high-end system builders all trust Corsair for high-performance memory that they can install with confidence and pride. Whether you're breaking your own records or you're simply building a dream gaming rig
 you can count on Corsair memory.
The DDR4 form factor is optimized for the latest Intel X99 and 100 Series motherboards and offers higher frequencies
 greater bandwidth
 and lower power consumption than DDR3 modules. Vengeance LPX DDR4 modules are compatibility-tested across X99 and 100 Series motherboards for reliably fast performance. There’s XMP 2.0 support for trouble-free automatic overclocking. And
 they’re available in multiple colors to match your motherboard
 your components
 or just your style in your CORSAIR 8-GB DDR4

VENGEANCE LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation
 and the eight-layer PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom.
DESIGNED FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE OVERCLOCKING
VENGEANCE LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation
 and the custom performance PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom. Each IC is individually screened for peak performance potential.
COMPATIBILITY TESTED
Part of our exhaustive testing process includes performance and compatibility testing on nearly every motherboard on the market – and a few that aren’t.
XMP 2.0 SUPPORT
One setting is all it takes to automatically adjust to the fastest safe speed for your VENGEANCE LPX kit. You’ll get amazing
 reliable performance without lockups or other strange behavior.
ALUMINUM HEAT SPREADER
Overclocking overhead is limited by operating temperature. The unique design of the VENGEANCE LPX heat spreader optimally pulls heat away from the ICs and into your system’s cooling path
 so you can push it harder.
LOW-PROFILE DESIGN
The small form factor makes it ideal for smaller cases or any system where internal space is at a premium.
MATCH YOUR SYSTEM
The best high-performance systems look as good as they run. VENGEANCE LPX is available in several colors to match your motherboard
 your other components
 your case -- or just your favorite color.
WORLD-FAMOUS RELIABILITY
There's a reason why world-champion overclockers
 extreme gaming enthusiasts and high-end system builders all trust CORSAIR for high-performance memory that they can install with confidence and pride. Whether you're breaking your own records or you're simply building a dream gaming rig
 you can count on CORSAIR memory.
