 Simpler Storage Technology: Enmotus FuzeDrive for AMD Ryzen
AMD has teamed up with high-end server storage technology company Enmotus to bring advanced
 intelligent storage acceleration to AMD Ryzen desktop processor owners!
 
In 2017
 AMD disrupted the processor market with Ryzen desktop processors
 delivering incredible multi-threaded performance to consumers. But in many ways
 platforms are just as important as the processors that sit on them. If you want to make a real difference in the way people experience PC performance
 you need to continuously push to open other bottlenecks like memory
 I/O
 and storage. That’s why we provided a free NVMe RAID upgrade to the X399 (Threadripper) platform in October of the same year
 enabling some of the most bandwidth ever seen on a consumer desktop platform.
While it’s great to push the limits of what’s possible for enthusiasts
 the average user isn’t going to invest a large amount of money in expensive
 high-capacity NVMe drives. So we looked for a way improve storage performance for everyone with a Ryzen desktop processor. We started with a list of goals
 like improving storage performance and lowering loading times. Because AMD believes in open hardware standards
 it prefers to work with off-the-shelf
 non-proprietary NVMe
 SSD
 and hard disk drives. Finally
 it must be convenient for users – any superior storage acceleration solution needs to be easy to set up
 and simple to use.
 
Introducing Enmotus FuzeDrive for Ryzen
 exclusively for AMD on Consumer Desktop PC
To achieve these goals
 AMD partnered with Enmotus
 a company that develops high-end server-class storage solutions designed to optimize both performance and capacity in the data center. We worked together to tailor Enmotus’ FuzeDrive software for use with AMD Ryzen desktop processors in the consumer desktop PC space
 for systems using the AMD B350 and X370 chipsets (Socket AM4* Ryzen 7
 5
 and 3*) and the X399 chipset (socket sTR4 Ryzen Threadripper).
Enmotus FuzeDrive does not support the AMD A320 chipset
 
How does Enmotus FuzeDrive for AMD Ryzen work?
First
 the FuzeDrive software analyzes all of the storage hardware available on your system
 from fastest to slowest: from DDR4 RAM
 to 3D Xpoint NVMe drives
 standard NVMe drives
 SSD drives
 and mechanical hard disks. During the setup process
 it combines these disks into what your system sees as a single
 larger disk. Unlike caching schemes
 FuzeDrive™ lets you use both the SSD and the HDD capacity together as one large boot drive. For example
 you can now combine a 128GB SSD and 2TB hard drive into a large bootable 2.1TB high performance FuzeDrive.
 
Once installed
 FuzeDrive intelligently and continuously analyzes your system
 activating an ongoing process to make it as fast and responsive as possible. For instance
 your Windows operating system boot files are moved to the fastest non-volatile storage to accelerate boot times. And as you use your PC from day to day
 FuzeDrive™ notices what applications you run and automatically prioritizes the applications and data you use the most
 so it’s accessed as quickly as possible from the fastest storage tier available. That means faster boot times
 faster application and game load times
 and a more responsive system.
 
AMD SenseMI Technology. Technology that thinks.
AMD introduces SenseMI technology
 a set of learning and adapting features that help the AMD Ryzen™ processor customize its performance to you and your applications. Finally: performance that thinks.
 
Pure Power
A sophisticated grid of smart sensors that monitors CPU temperature
 resource usage and power draw brings cool and quiet operation to your AMD Ryzen processor with intelligent power optimization circuits
 plus the low power requirements of an advanced 14nm FinFET manufacturing technology.
 
Precision Boost
Fine-tuned processor performance adjusted in real time to meet the performance demands of your game or app.
Adjusts clockspeeds in 25MHz increments to optimize performanceClockspeed changes can occur without pausing work
 
Precision Boost 
Gracefully raises processor frequencies for snappier performance on any number of CPU cores.
The AMD Ryzen™ processor with Radeon Graphics monitors its own energy consumption and temperature.When the processor knows it's running cool and quiet
 it can raise clock speeds in precise 25MHz steps for any application
 
Neural Net Prediction
A true artificial intelligence inside every AMD Ryzen processor employs an artificial neural network to understand your applications and anticipate the next steps of your workflow in real time. These “powers of prediction” can boost performance by steering your apps and games down the most efficient paths inside the processor.
 
Extended Frequency Range (XFR)
Automatic extra performance boost for enthusiasts with premium systems and processor cooling.
Permits CPU speeds above and beyond ordinary Precision Boost limitsClockspeed scales with cooling solution: air
 water
 and LN2Fully automated; no user input requiredAvailable on select AMD Ryzen processors
Mobile Extended Frequency Range (mXFR)Greater processor performance with a premium notebook chassis.
 
Higher processor clock speeds offer more performance to the user.
A premium notebook cooling solution can comfortably and quietly handle these higher energy requirements.mXFR allows AMD Ryzen mobile processors to offer faster performance in laptop systems.
 
Smart Prefetch
Sophisticated learning algorithms understand the inner workings of your applications and anticipate what data they might need. Smart Prefetch predictively brings that data into the AMD Ryzen™ processor for fast and responsive computing."

Overview:
Overwhelming Power.
The AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X processor is designed to provide indisputable multi-processing
 
Supremacy on the X399 ultimate platform for desktop.
8 cores provide an astonishing 16 threads of simultaneous multi-processing power
 while 20MB of combined cache and vast I/O from the enthusiast-grade AMD X399 platform stand ready to feed the beast.

 Simpler Storage Technology: Enmotus FuzeDrive for AMD Ryzen
In 2017
 AMD disrupted the processor market with Ryzen™ desktop processors
 delivering incredible multi-threaded performance to consumers. But in many ways
 platforms are just as important as the processors that sit on them. If you want to make a real difference in the way people experience PC performance
 you need to continuously push to open other bottlenecks like memory
 I/O
 and storage. That’s why we provided a free NVMe RAID upgrade to the X399 (Threadripper) platform in October of the same year
 enabling some of the most bandwidth ever seen on a consumer desktop platform.
While it’s great to push the limits of what’s possible for enthusiasts
 the average user isn’t going to invest a large amount of money in expensive
 high-capacity NVMe drives. So we looked for a way improve storage performance for everyone with a Ryzen desktop processor. We started with a list of goals
 like improving storage performance and lowering loading times. Because AMD believes in open hardware standards
 it prefers to work with off-the-shelf
 non-proprietary NVMe
 SSD
 and hard disk drives. Finally
 it must be convenient for users any superior storage acceleration solution needs to be easy to set up
 and simple to use.
 
Introducing Enmotus FuzeDrive for Ryzen
 Exclusively for AMD on Consumer Desktop PCs
To achieve these goals
 AMD partnered with Enmotus
 a company that develops high-end server-class storage solutions designed to optimize both performance and capacity in the data center. We worked together to tailor Enmotus’ FuzeDrive software for use with AMD Ryzen desktop processors in the consumer desktop PC space
 for systems using the AMD B350 and X370 chipsets (Socket AM4* Ryzen™ 7
 5
 and 3*) and the X399 chipset.
How does Enmotus FuzeDrive for AMD Ryzen work?
First
 the FuzeDrive software analyzes all of the storage hardware available on your system
 from fastest to slowest: from DDR4 RAM
 to 3D Xpoint NVMe drives
 standard NVMe drives
 SSD drives
 and mechanical hard disks. During the setup process
 it combines these disks into what your system sees as a single
 larger disk. Unlike caching schemes
 FuzeDrive lets you use both the SSD and the HDD capacity together as one large boot drive. For example
 you can now combine a 128GB SSD and 2TB hard drive into a large bootable 2.1TB high performance FuzeDrive.
Once installed
 FuzeDrive intelligently and continuously analyzes your system
 activating an ongoing process to make it as fast and responsive as possible. For instance
 your Windows operating system boot files are moved to the fastest non-volatile storage to accelerate boot times. And as you use your PC from day to day
 FuzeDrive notices what applications you run and automatically prioritizes the applications and data you use the most
 so it’s accessed as quickly as possible from the fastest storage tier available. That means faster boot times
 faster application and game load times
 and a more responsive system in your AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7 1900X."
